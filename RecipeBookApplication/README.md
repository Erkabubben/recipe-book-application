## RecipeBookApplication

I'm sure some bugs still exist, but there aren't any major usability issues that I'm aware of. All input exceptions are handled by the ValidateInput class, and I've also been pretty consistent with correcting bugs as I find them, rather than leaving them for later. I have implemented all the passing grade requirements, and also some extra functionality for editing recipes and an additional search strategy.
